✅ Vulnerability Assessment Report Using Nessus Essentials

1. Install OpenVAS or Nessus Essentials

For this task, I chose Nessus Essentials — a free version of the Tenable Nessus vulnerability scanner for educational use. It was installed from the official Tenable website and activated using a valid license key provided via email.


2. Set up scan target as your local machine IP or localhost

I used ipconfig on Windows to find my local machine’s active IP address. The correct IP was:192.168.127.40

This address belongs to my Wi-Fi adapter and represents my Windows system on the local network. I entered this as the target in Nessus.


3. Start a full vulnerability scan

I created a new scan using the “Basic Network Scan” template provided by Nessus Essentials. The settings included:

Scanner: Local

Scan Target: 192.168.127.40

No credentials were provided (non-authenticated scan)

All ports and services were scanned

4. Wait for scan to complete 

The scan was started at 7:43 PM and completed at approximately 8:33 PM. It took just under 50 minutes to fully analyze the system and gather vulnerability data.

5. Review the report for vulnerabilities and severity
Once completed, the scan report listed:

Critical vulnerabilities: 1

High vulnerabilities: 1

Medium vulnerabilities: 6

Info-level findings: 45

Total vulnerabilities: 53

These were categorized by severity and included detailed plugin information, CVSS scores, and links to remediation resources.
